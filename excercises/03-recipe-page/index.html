            Custard Pie is a very popular sweet in Turkey, Syria, and Greece 
            and it’s definitely one of my favorite desserts that is incredibly 
            unique! Think of this Custard Pie like baklawa but instead of a nut 
            filling, it’s a creamy custard in the center. It’s buttery, crispy, 
            perfectly sweetened, and surprisingly not too difficult to make!

        <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
        <h4>MAKE THE SYRUP</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                While the ashta cools down, make the simple syrup. In a pot 
                over medium heat add the water, sugar, and orange blossom 
                water.
            </li>
            <li>Bring to a boil so all the sugar is dissolved and then reduce 
                the heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes. Transfer to a bowl 
                and allow to cool to room temperature so it thickens up a bit 
                more.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>MAKE THE CUSTARD</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a mixing bowl, add the 4 eggs and 1/3 cup sugar. Beat 
                together with a whisk until lighter in color. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                To a small pot over medium heat, add the heavy cream, milk, 
                sugar, salt, cornstarch, semolina, and vanilla extract.
            </li>
            <li>
                Whisk continuously and bring to a boil. Once bubbling, reduce 
                the heat, bring it to a simmer, and continuously whisk so it 
                doesn't become clumpy until it thickens up.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once thick, take off the heat and add the butter. Mix to 
                incorporate in.
            </li>
            <li>
                Slowly add a bit of the custard into the egg mixture, mixing 
                every time to temper the eggs. Then add all the hot custard in 
                and mix until smooth and creamy.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>ASSEMBLY AND BAKE</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 350°F.
            </li>
            <li>
                Take out phyllo sheets and cover them with a damp clean towel 
                to keep them from drying out.
            </li>
            <li>
                Brush the bottom of a 9x13 tray with the melted butter. 
                Add a sheet of phyllo dough, letting the sides hang over on the 
                edges of the pans.
            </li>
            <li>
                Brush the phyllo sheet with butter and add another sheet on 
                top. Repeat this step of phyllo and butter until you have 9 to 
                10 phyllo sheets stacked, or half the package.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour the custard on top of the phyllo sheet and now repeat the 
                phyllo sheet and butter layers again until you have another 9 
                to 10 layers.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cut with a sharp knife into 12 equal pieces.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer to the oven and bake for 45 to 50 minutes until the 
                top is golden and crispy.
            </li>
            <li>
                Take out of the oven and immediately pour the simple syrup all 
                across, adding as much or as little as you like.
            </li>
            <li>
                Garnish with chopped pistachios and rose petals.
            </li>
            <li>
                Allow the syrup to soak for at least an hour before enjoying!
            </li>
