                <b>Crown shyness</b> (also <i>canopy disengagement</i>, <sup><a href="#">[1]</a></sup> <i>canopy shyness</i>, <sup><a href="#">[2] or <i>inter-crown spacing</i> <sup><a href="#">[3]</a></sup>) is a phenomenon observedin some tree species, in which the crowns of fully stocked trees do not touch each other, forming a canopy with channel-like gaps. <sup><a href="#">[4]</a></sup><sup><a href="#">[5]</a></sup> The phenomenon is most prevalent among trees of the same species, but also occurs between trees of different species. <sup><a href="#">[6]</a></sup><a href="#">[7]</a></sup> There exist many hypotheses as to why crown shyness is an adaptive behavior, and research suggests that it might inhibit spread of leaf-eating insect larvae.<sup><a href="#">[8]</a></sup>

            The exact physiological basis of crown shyness is uncertain. <sup><a href="#">[6]</a></sup> The phenomenon has been discussed in scientific literature since the 1920s.<sup><a href="#">[9]</a></sup> The variety of hypotheses and experimental results might suggest that there are multiple mechanisms across different species, an example of convergent evolution. <sup><a href="#">[citation needed]</a></sup>

            Some hypotheses contend that the interdigitation of canopy branches 
            leads to "reciprocal pruning" of adjacent trees: trees in windy 
            areas suffer physical damage as they collide with each other during 
            winds; the abrasions and collisions induce a crown shyness 
            response. Studies suggest that lateral branch growth is largely 
            uninfluenced by neighbours until disturbed by mechanical abrasion.
            <sup><a href="#">[10]</a></sup> If the crowns are artificially 
            prevented from colliding in the winds, they gradually fill the 
            canopy gaps.<sup><a href="#">[11]</a></sup> This explains instances 
            of crown shyness between branches of the same organism. Proponents 
            of this idea cite that shyness is particularly seen in conditions 
            conducive to this pruning, including windy forests, stands of 
            flexible trees, and early succession forests where branches are 
            flexible and limited in lateral movement. According to this theory, 
            variable flexibility in lateral branches greatly influences the 
            degree of crown shyness.
