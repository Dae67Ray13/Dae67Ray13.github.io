                    Camp Half-Blood is a Greek demigod training facility. The 
                    camp is directed by the centaur Chiron, and Heracles, a 
                    demigod turned god who is the activities director.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The camp has magical borders which are enforced by the 
                    Golden Fleece Stolen from Polyphemus' island, it was placed 
                    on Thalia's Pine Tree, ensuring that no monster could get 
                    into camp. The Fleece stays on the tree, guarded by the 
                    dragon Peleus, its magical powers protecting the camp from 
                    monsters and invaders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The camp is described as being the only safe place for 
                    half-bloods. The half-bloods live in cabins, and eat at the 
                    dining pavilion. There is also an archery field, a sword 
                    fighting arena, a climbing wall with lava for training, an 
                    amphitheater, stables, an armory, and the Big House.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The camp's cover name is Delphi Strawberry Service, a 
                    reference to the name of the Oracle of Delphi.
